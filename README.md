## Main Goal
This project consists of creating a **mobile-responsive web application** designed to manage and edit data from three separate objects, `groupMe`, `flare`, and `campusGroups`, in one central location.

## Problem I am Solving
I am a member of the Lambda Sigma Phi fraternity chapter at the University of North Alabama. A lot of our communication and event registration is done using applications on our mobile devices. However, this tends to be an issue because we have to use several different apps for communication and event registration. The three applications we use the most are GroupMe, Flare, and CampusGroups, and this tends to be very confusing as we have to switch between the three applications because they each serve a particular purpose. GroupMe focuses more on communication, Flare focuses more on birthdays and inner-fraternity/sorority events, and CampusGroups focuses on events that Greek Life members from any chapter can attend. The purpose of creating the GreekLink application is to combine GroupMe, Flare, and CampusGroup elements into one application so that users do not have to switch back and forth between apps that serve similar purposes. The idea for GreekLink came from a group project I completed in CIS 330. The web app I have built for this project is not the entirety of what the GreekLink application would be, but it is what the registration page would look like for the application. The web app I have created shows how each of the three applications I am attempting to combine come together to create one central hub that fraternity and sorority life members can use to prevent confusion and make accessing GreekLife information easier.

## Features  
* One webpage, or central location, that a fraternity or sorority member can go to for accessing, learning, or editing data related to fraternity and sorority life.  
* The load data button at the top left of the page allows a user to quickly load in their personal data to make learning about and registering for events easier. 
* Three separate cards (one for GroupMe, Flare, and CampusGroups respectively) in a form that are set up for a user to put in their information, learn about events, and register for the events they want to go to.
* Once the user is satisfied with the information they have put in, they can hit the submit and confirm information button at the bottom of the page. After clicking this button, the data they input will be logged to the console in JSON format and the user will receive a personalized message back saying that their data was collected successfully.
* The app is also styled with a **green, black, and white color scheme** as these are the official colors of GreekLink.

## Simple How to Use Guide
1. Open the app in a browser.  
2. Click the **Load Data** button to populate the cards with default  user data.  
3. Edit the values in the form fields as desired.  
4. Click **Submit** to save changes, receive a message stating that the data has been collected, and view the JSON output in the console.

## GreekLink Prototype from CIS 330
Here are some images of the prototype I built in CIS 330 for the GreekLink application. The first image is the login screen, which most closely relates to the webpage application I built for this project, and the rest of the images show what the rest of the main pages of the application would look like if it was finalized.
