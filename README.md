about this: https://gbouldin43.github.io/urban-broccoli-sobie-profile/
and the app: ...

## Main Goal
This project consists of creating a **profile** for the Sobie Development Company designed to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` objects in a database from my profile webpage. The goal for the CRUD functionality of this webpage is for users to add their favorite movie and actor/actress from that movie to the database that is linked to my webpage.

## Features  
* restfulAPI, SPA, MVC paradigms 
* c-r-u-d functionality 
* authentication, security measures (secrets, injections)
* static readme deployment, verbose repository
* clean, logical, functional source code to code standards
* valid and expected tech stack

## Sobie Dev Co Preview
Here is what my completed Sobie Dev Co webpage would look like to someone who ventures to my page. I have images of the top, middle, and bottom sections of the webpage included here. The top section of the webpage is an introduction to my profile and let's users know what to expect from the webpage. The middle section of the webpage includes personal information and some previous projects that I have worked on. The bottom section of the page is where anyone can create, read, update, or delete the database that is linked with the webpage.
