## GreekLink Prototype from CIS 330
Here are some images of the prototype I built in CIS 330 for the GreekLink application. The first image is the login screen, which most closely relates to the webpage application I built for this project, and the rest of the images show what the rest of the main pages of the application would look like if it was finalized.
